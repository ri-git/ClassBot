# ClassBot

A project to make a discord bot for automatically joining online classes. 

The discord bot asks the user for login credentials and Class Time Table, and voila! All classes are automatically joined as per
the weekly time table using the login credentials. 

Although presently developed for IITD moodle login, we plan to extend it to MS-Teams and Webex as well.
